# cloud-portal-public-repo

The Portal API web services as seen by external clients (e.g. Portal web applications).  

## HOW-TO run  

This project uses Spring-Boot and Maven. In order to run it, just run  

    mvn spring-boot:run  

 The API entry point is the root [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).  

Right now the API endpoints are only accessible by `jwt` tokens.  

### Properties  

For the application to be setup, follow the comments in application.properties.

I. The file 'application.properties' has been divided into two sections. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Settings to be modified 
   Users please follow the comments under this heading, minimal setup is required to get portal running.
   
2. Settings which can be used a boilerplate 	
   Users can use it as it is, no modification is required

### Dependencies  

The portal backend needs a DB and an ElasticSearch index. Both of them can be provided using Docker containers. The properties file contains comments about how to run them.  

#### ElasticSearch index

The ElasticSearch instance has to have an index defined, that matches the `elasticsearch.index` 
specified in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file. If you use the above mentioned `docker-elk` setup,
you visit the Kibana GUI at http://localhost:5601 with the `elasticsearch.*` credentials, 
and use Kibana console (in the devtools tab) to send the index creation command to its API:  

```
PUT ecp-deployments
{
    "settings" : {
        "index" : {
            "number_of_shards" : 1, 
            "number_of_replicas" : 1 
        }
    }
}
```
Production environments must change the credentials, and should tweak the settings depending on the workload.

## Example usage

Once the Portal API web services are up and running, clients can make REST calls. The client authorisation 
is performed with JSON Web Tokens (https://jwt.io/) which are issued by the EBI's Authentication and Authorization Profile (AAP) infrastructure. You can manually log into https://aai.ebi.ac.uk/login with the Elixir Single-Sign-On,
and copy the token displayed on https://api.aai.ebi.ac.uk/sso. Web clients can use libraries like https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-aap-auth to handle the process. An example call to the API returns the list of deployments, 
which is initially empty `{}`:
```
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJh...K0GA' -X GET http://localhost:8080/deployment
```

## Design  

The RESTful API is designed under the [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) constraint in order to allow clients to be as decoupled as possible from its specification.

## Default Teams

We wanted to group people in teams namely EMBL-EBI (UK based) and EMBL (whole EMBL except UK) so that sharing and un-sharing resources can be done organization wide, which would help people to adopt the Cloud Portal easily.

This is the information in /default_teams.json file.

People who sign in and having email id’s ending in ‘ebi.ac.uk’ would be automatically in team EBI and those having email id’s ending in ‘embl.de’ would be in team EMBL.

Developers can adopt this idea and customize to suit their organization.
